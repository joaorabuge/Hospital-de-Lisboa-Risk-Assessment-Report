# Hospital de Lisboa: Risk Assessment Report

## Overview

This project focuses on a comprehensive risk assessment for a fictional organization, Hospital de Lisboa. The report identifies key assets, potential threats, existing vulnerabilities, and evaluates the associated risks to provide recommendations for enhancing security measures. The goal is to ensure the protection of both physical and digital assets, operational continuity, and compliance with regulatory standards in the healthcare industry.

## Key Topics

- **Assets Identification:** Categorization of tangible assets (e.g., medical equipment), intangible assets (e.g., brand reputation), and data assets (e.g., patient records).
- **Threats and Vulnerabilities:** Identification of physical threats (e.g., natural disasters), cyber threats (e.g., data breaches), and operational threats (e.g., equipment failure).
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of risks based on their probability and potential impact, focusing on areas such as customer base, employee training, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property protection.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Implementation of physical security measures, cybersecurity protocols, and operational safeguards to minimize risk exposure.

## Conclusion

The risk assessment reveals critical areas needing attention, particularly regulatory compliance and customer base expansion. Continuous monitoring and updates to the risk management strategy are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of hospital operations. These practices will help ensure the hospital can provide high-quality healthcare services securely and efficiently.
